	<h2>About Hunter Krieger</h2>
	<p>I'm a web developer, game designer, musician, bibliophile and blogger in his late 20's, trying to create and build things both economically valuable and/or intrinsically satisfying just to pass the time constructively before my mind and body gives out.</p>
	
	<p>I've picked up web programming over the past 5 or so years using web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python etc...  and so far I've built a number of websites for others and myself (Including this one.  Also see <a href="http://www.brineyconstructionservices.com">brineyconstructionservices.com</a> and <a href="http://www.winamacpowershow.com">www.winamacpowershow.com</a>) </p>
	
	<p>I'm an obsessive reader who reads psychology, history, economics, video games, music etc. and my goal is to read a book a week and write about it.   I will fall short many times but it's a good goal to shoot for.</p>
	
	<p>I'm a musician who has played guitar and piano for about a decade.  I'm not a musical prodigy but I know my scales, chords, arpeggios, progressions etc. and can play by ear.  </p>
	
	<p>I've had a pet interest in the medium of video games and have dabbled in game development as well.  Even though I've learned a lot having made a few unfinished prototypes and one published level of a platformer in Unity and C#, I've regretably had to put that hobby on hiatus to focus on other things.  But in no time I look forward to picking it up again using C# and Monogame game framework.  Although people tend to dismiss video games as a time-wasting hobby, I've found it to be an interesting artform to study up on.  </p>
