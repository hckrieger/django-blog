	<h2>About Hunter Krieger</h2>
	<p>I'm web developer, game designer, musician, bibliophile and blogger in his early 20's, trying to create and build things (better than being depressed, useless and miserable) both economically valuable and/or intrinsically satisfying just to pass the time before my mind and body gives out (Projected death date: circa 2080)</p>
	<p>The plan is to read a book a week and summarize it briefly.  The refund for Kindle e-books on amazon last until 7 days...If I fail to finish a book within that time span then I have practically lost money.</p>
